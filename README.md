### Project Description
This application allows the user to search a database of films by ID number or
keyword.  The keyword search searches both titles and film descriptions in the
database.  Search queries join numerous tables in the database to return the film,
a list of actors, and the film's language.  If the search returns no results,
"No film found" is returned.
